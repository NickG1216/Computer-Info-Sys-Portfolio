This section of my portfolio provides a solid and practical foundation for the design and implementation of database systems. Emphasis is on the relational database model, with significant coverage of basic relational database concepts, normalization, E-R modeling, and SQL. 
Additional topics include data warehouse, fundamental transaction management concepts, and more recent data storage technologies.
this demonstrates experince with Microsoft Visio and SQL server. 

Other features of this section are:
* A hands-on approach to database design, implementation, and use.
*	Detailed coverage of E-R modeling as the basis for database design.
* Extensive coverage of the relational model, normalization, and SQL
* Coverage of current topics such as big data (as time permits).
* Coverage of the database life cycle as an integral part of the systems development life cycle.
