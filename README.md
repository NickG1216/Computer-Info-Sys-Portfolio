# Computer-Info-Sys-Portfolio
A snapshot of the assignments that I have completed over my undergraduate career

I'm a University of Louisville Computer Information Systems student seeking an internship that uses basic web development and programming skills. My interests are also expanded into becoming a professional musician. I have mulitple experiences in working with others on a team, strong organizational skills, and I'm able to manage a heavy workload.
