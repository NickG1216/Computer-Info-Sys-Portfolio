# Computer-Info-Sys-Portfolio
A snapshot of the assignments that I have completed over my undergraduate career

<br>
I'm a University of Louisville Computer Information Systems graduate seeking an entry level position that uses basic web development and programming skills. <img align="right" src="https://github.com/NickG1216/Files/blob/master/DSC_0005-1.jpg">My interests are also expanded into becoming a professional composer. My primary instrument is the euphonium (yoo-pho-ni-um), and it's shaped like a small tuba. Eventually, I would like to begin teaching private lessons on my instrument while pursuing a career in IT. I have mulitple experiences in working with others on a team, strong organizational skills, and I'm able to manage a heavy workload. Other soft skills include: 

* Time Mangement
* Leadership Skills
* Quick study

This portfolio summarizes and displays all those things in an efficient, yet convenient way to any potential employers.
