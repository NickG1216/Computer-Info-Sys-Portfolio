# Computer-Info-Sys-Portfolio
A snapshot of the assignments that I have completed over my undergraduate career <img align="right" src="https://github.com/NickG1216/Files/blob/master/DSC_0005-1.jpg">

<br>

I'm a University of Louisville Computer Information Systems student seeking an entry level position that uses basic web development and programming skills. My interests are also expanded into becoming a professional musician. My primary instrument is the euphonium (yoo-pho-ni-um), and it's shaped like a small tuba. Eventually, I would like to begin teaching private lessons on my instrument while pursuing a career as a developer. I have mulitple experiences in working with others on a team, strong organizational skills, and I'm able to manage a heavy workload. Other soft skills include:

* Time Mangement
* Leadership Skills
* Quick study

This portfolio summarizes and displays all those things in an efficient, yet convenient way to any potential employers.
