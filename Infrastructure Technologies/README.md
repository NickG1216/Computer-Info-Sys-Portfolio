This course provided an introduction to IT infrastructure issues and covers topics related to computer and systems architecture and 
communication networks, with an overall focus on the services and capabilities that IT infrastructure solutions enable in an organizational
context. It gave me the knowledge and skills that I need to communicate effectively with professionals whose special focus is 
on hardware and systems software technology and for designing processes and solutions that require in-depth understanding of the IT 
infrastructure capabilities and limitations. It also prepared me for interactions with external vendors of IT infrastructure 
components and solutions.
