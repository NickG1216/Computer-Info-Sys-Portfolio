This section of my portfolio demonstrates the practical business application of my coursework.
It explores strategic development of information technology; value chain analysis and its application to information resource management;
information systems planning; organizing, staffing, and controlling the deployment of information technology; 
the development of an IT platform and architecture consistent with organizational structure through the use of case studies.

It also introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented analysis and design, including experience with a CASE tool. 
Topics include requirements determination, feasibility analysis, modeling with Unified Modeling Language (UML) and data dictionary 
construction, data modeling and normalization, user interface requirements specification, and information security procedures. See the elaboration spec folder for the completed systems lifecycle of a small online cake shop.
