This section of my portfolio features the extent of my programming experience to date. 
It features examples of code and some front-end prototypes that I have designed with ux-pin.

# Software Development I
This course introduces object-oriented concepts such as the use of classes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance.
The course concentrates on using object-oriented programming to solve simple problems involving input and output

# Software Development II
This course emphasizes object-oriented software development. Students study the object model and apply it to systems development problems.
Topics include polymorphism, inheritance, and object interaction. Event-driven programming of graphical user interfaces is introduced. 
Application areas may include data structures, searching, sorting, and databases.
