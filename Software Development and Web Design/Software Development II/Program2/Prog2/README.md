This program creates a basic Library class that stores a list of LibraryItems and a list of LibraryPatrons. It allows items to be
checked out by patrons. The lists are accessible to other classes in the same namespace (LibraryItems).
Unlike the previous iterations, this program uses windows forms to output the information from a test program.
